"Add a button on each book’s display to remove the book from the library"
1. Add button on each card using JS? (may need to add to build library function)
2. when button is triggered, finds current book (use data-attribute that refers to book's index) and sets that index value to null in array
3. then removes div with that value from the page/DOM
4. Also, I'll need to change the initial build library function to ignore null values in array
