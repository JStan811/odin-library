1. Design page on paper
  - Done.
2. Write psuedo-code
  - Done.
3. Research how to implement (may want to go back through JS Foundations course)
4. Code

Misc.
  - Do I need to put attributions for the google font and color scheme (#23 from https://webflow.com/blog/best-color-combinations)?
    - maybe just add a section to README (font used: color combo from: etc.)
  - improve button designs
  - improve new book form design
  - improve card container design (why does it flex the way it does? I have flex wrap set to wrap but align/justify are default, so why are things organizing themselves the way they are?)
  - form validation
  - refactoring:
    - clean up addContentsToBookCard function
    - clean up addBookToLibraryOnSubmit function
