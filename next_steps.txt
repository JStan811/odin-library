1. Design page on paper
  - Done.
2. Write psuedo-code
  - Done.
3. Research how to implement (may want to go back through JS Foundations course)
4. Code

Misc.
  - Do I need to put attributions for the google font and color scheme (#23 from https://webflow.com/blog/best-color-combinations?
    - maybe just add a section to README (font used: color combo from: etc.)
  - design new book button and change read status button
  - improve card design (hard width/height values? make buttons look better? how to organize information in a better looking way? How to handle super long titles (this could probably be handled with form validation)?)
  - improve form design
  - form validation
